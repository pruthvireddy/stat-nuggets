#Stratification


#Matching

Matching methods attempt to replicate two features of randomized experiments

Ideal Scenario: "Exact Matching" on all covariates


# Propensity Score

Probability of receiving the exposure (E) given the baseline covariates(X)

E<sub>i</sbp>) = P()

Propensity score exists both in randomized control experiments too but is O/NULL

Propensity score is a summary of a persons baseline characteristics.
You can use it instead of matching on all the covariates
